/**
 * 3012.Decode String
 * Given an encoded string, return it's decoded string.
 *
 * The encoding rule is: k[encoded_string],
 * where the encoded_string inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly k times.
 *  Note that k is guaranteed to be a positive integer.
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * You may assume that the input string is always valid, No extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc.
 *
 * Also, the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those repeat numbers, k.
 * For example, there won't be input like 3a or 2[4].
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * "3[a]2[bc]" -> "aaabcbc".
 *
 * "3[a2[c]]" -> "accaccacc"
 *
 * "2[abc]3[cd]ef" -> "abcabccdcdcdef"
